# Capstone_2
*For this capstone project, I will demonstrate my ability to clean and analyze data using Python in a business context. The project consists of two main tasks related to real-world business data:*

*Task 1: Cleaning and Structuring the Marketing List*
*In the first part of the project, I’m tasked with working on a marketing list for my growing business. The application I use to collect customer information has generated the list in an awkward format, with some data containing errors and missing values. My goal is to write a Python program that:*
- *Takes the messy customer data as input.*
- *Separates the data into proper columns and rows, organizing it in a structured format.*
- *Cleans up any errors or missing values (such as incorrect email addresses, phone numbers, or incomplete fields).*
- *Exports the cleaned-up data into a CSV file, which is a commonly used format for storing structured data.*
*I’ll use Python’s libraries like pandas to read, manipulate, and clean the data, ensuring that it’s ready for further analysis or use in marketing campaigns.*

*Task 2: Analyzing Sales Data for Business Insights*
*In the second part of the project, I’ll analyze a set of 2024 transaction data to understand how my business is performing. This data includes information about customer purchases, sales, and product performance. My task is to:*
- *Load the transaction data into a Jupyter Notebook using Python and the pandas library.*
- *Display the data as a DataFrame, showing the first 10 rows to get an overview and including a description that summarizes basic statistical details (e.g., mean, median, and standard deviation).*
- *Generate additional insights by applying aggregation functions (like calculating total sales or average order values) or statistical methods to identify patterns and trends.*
- *Create at least one data plot (e.g., a bar chart or line graph) using Matplotlib to visually represent the analysis, making it easier to identify key trends or comparisons in the data.*
- *Provide clear, concise explanations of the data, the insights, and the visualizations in markdown cells within the notebook.*

*Project Deliverables:*
- *Python Program: I will create a console application (or a Jupyter Notebook) that processes the marketing list, cleans up bad data, and saves the cleaned data to a CSV file.*
- *Jupyter Notebook for Analysis: I will use pandas to load and explore the transaction data, calculate summary statistics, perform additional analyses, and create at least one plot to visualize the findings. I will also document my analysis with markdown explanations to ensure clarity.*

*By completing this project, I will demonstrate my ability to handle real-world business data using Python, perform data cleaning tasks, and generate meaningful insights through data analysis and visualization.*
